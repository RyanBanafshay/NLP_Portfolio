## Text Processing Assignment #1
This program will take a data file and process the informationg within the file into a proper format. If data is inputted incorrectly, the program will ask the user to manually re-enter the data. The program will then save the entries into a file and display it back to the user.

To run the program, have a data.csv file containing the data to be processed. The content is ordered by last name, first name, middle initial, employee ID, and phone number. Employee ID must be formatted with the first two characters as letters and the last four characters as digit 0-9. This data.csv file needs to be placed in a data folder in the same directory as the program.

With this being my first experience developing with Python, I noticed how much better suited the language is with processing text than either C++ or Java. There is a vast number of libraries to call upon which helps streamlines the development process. What I mostly gathered from this assignment is how efficent Python is as a language.
